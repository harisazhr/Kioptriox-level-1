# Kioptriox-level-1

# Objective

Successfully identify and exploit vulnerabilities in Kioptrix Level 1, a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine, to gain root access. This exercise focuses on fundamental penetration testing skills including reconnaissance, enumeration, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation.

**Target:** Kioptrix Level 1  
**Goal:** Root Shell Access ✅  
**Assessment Date:** January 15, 2026

## Skills Learned

- Network reconnaissance and host discovery using `netdiscover` and `nmap`
- Service enumeration and version detection
- SMB/Samba service enumeration with `smbclient`
- Vulnerability research using `searchsploit` and online databases
- Buffer overflow exploitation (Samba trans2open CVE-2003-0201)

## Tools Used

- **Kali Linux 2025** - Primary attack platform
- **nmap** - Network scanning and service enumeration
- **netdiscover** - Network host discovery
- **smbclient** - SMB/CIFS service enumeration
- **searchsploit** - Local exploit database search
- **Metasploit Framework** - Auxiliary scanning modules
- **gcc** - Exploit compilation
- **VirtualBox** - Virtualization environment
